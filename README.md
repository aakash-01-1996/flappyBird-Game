# Flappy Bird Game

This project contains a Flappy Bird game developed using the Python programming language and the Pygame game development library. In this project, reflecting the classic and entertaining game mechanics, players control a bird and navigate it through obstacles to see how long they can survive.

## Gameplay

The player's objective is to control the bird, maneuvering it through pipes and earning the highest score possible. Players can make the bird flap upwards by pressing the spacebar on the keyboard. However, precise timing is essential to prevent the bird from falling too quickly. If the bird collides with pipes or the ground, the game ends.
